## Background and Overview
News Center is a live look at how the current topics of the day are being covered across the mainstream media. See the top articles featured on the homepages of CNN, Fox News, NBC, NYTimes, and the Huffington Post all at once. This app, built using React, serves as the frontend and works in sync with my news center backend api (https://github.com/parfittchris/newsCenterAPI/) which builds the the endpoint this app contacts. The news articles are updated every 3 hours using an ansyncronous web scraping script. 

## Features
Shows 15 top news article headlines from the front pages of top mainstream media sites. Clicking on each title will link the user to the actual article.
